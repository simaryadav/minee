    This project aims to develop a novel way of monitoring patients with lymphoma and find a new immunotherapy regimen
    that would be effective in patients that are not cured with conventional chemotherapy. They will first genetically
    profile the tumours to determine at which time point they become resistant. They will then determine how these
    lymphomas evade immune detection and test if targeting these evasion strategies, i.e. "harnessing the immune response"
    is successful at eradicating chemo-resistant lymphoma.
